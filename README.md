# JsonParser

This project is a JSON parser implementation based on the challenge from [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser).

## Project Description

This JSON parser is designed to parse JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data, a lightweight data-interchange format widely used for transmitting data over the Internet. The parser is built from scratch, following the formal JSON specification as defined by the IETF [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/std90).

## Features

The parser implements the following features:

1. Parsing of simple JSON objects (`{}`)
2. Parsing of JSON objects with string keys and string values
3. Parsing of JSON objects with string, numeric, boolean, and null values
4. Parsing of JSON objects with nested objects and arrays
5. Validation of JSON syntax with appropriate error messages for invalid JSON

## How to Use

[Provide instructions on how to use your JSON parser]

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure the parser's correctness. Tests are organized into the following stages:

1. Step 1: Parsing simple `{}` objects and invalid JSON
2. Step 2: Parsing objects with string keys and values
3. Step 3: Parsing objects with various data types (string, numeric, boolean, null)
4. Step 4: Parsing objects with nested objects and arrays
5. Step 5: Custom tests for edge cases and error handling
